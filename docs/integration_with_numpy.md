    df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [10], 'B': [20]})

    # Broadcasting addition operation
    result = df1 + df2

    print(result)
    ```

    - In this example:
      - Two Pandas DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) with different shapes are added together using the `+` operator.
      - NumPy broadcasting automatically aligns the DataFrames and extends the addition operation to match the larger DataFrame's shape.
      - The result is a new Pandas DataFrame (`result`) where the addition is performed element-wise across the DataFrames seamlessly, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of broadcasting in Pandas DataFrames.
