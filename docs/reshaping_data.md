    'Chicago_temp': [25, 27, 23],
    'Chicago_humidity': [55, 58, 60]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Using the melt function to reshape the data
melted_df = df.melt(id_vars='date', var_name='city_weather', value_name='value')

print(melted_df)
```
This code snippet demonstrates how the `melt` function can reshape the data by unpivoting temperature and humidity columns for different cities across dates into a long format.

        'Category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [10, 20, 15, 25]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Pivoting the DataFrame
pivoted_df = df.pivot(index='Date', columns='Category', values='Value')

print(pivoted_df)
```

### Follow-up questions:

#### How does the `pivot_table` differ from the `pivot` function in reshaping data?
